 * at which taskDelay() gets called and therefore the time at which the task
 * next executes.  See taskDelayUntil() for an alternative API function designed
 * to facilitate fixed frequency execution.  It does this by specifying an

 * unblock.  Storing the loop start time and delaying until an offset is effective.
 *
 * @param previousWakeTime Pointer to a variable that holds the time at which the
